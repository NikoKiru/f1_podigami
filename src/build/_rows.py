"""Shared ranked-table renderer for the Overdue, Unlikeliest and Soulmates pages.

The three pages present the same shape of content — a ranked list of driver
groupings, each with one headline number and a handful of supporting stats — so
they render through one component that mirrors the Combinations table
cell-for-cell: a single hairline frame with no outer panel, an uppercase
column-label strip, flat rows at the page type size, and an expanded drawer on
``--bg-2`` behind an accent rail.

Every entry is one native ``<details>`` row: the ``<summary>`` is the row face
(drivers, headline number, optional race) and the body holds the stat cells.
Closed shows the headline stat only; open reveals the detail — including for
#1, which is a normal closed row carrying nothing but an accent rail to mark it
as the leader. The list carries no ordinal column: it is an ordered ``<ol>``
and position says the same thing.

Column geometry lives in one custom property (``--rank-cols``, a CSS grid track
list set per page), shared by the label strip and every row face, so labels sit
directly above their values with no layout engine.

Callers pass pre-escaped HTML fragments (driver spans, stat cells, race link);
this module only assembles structure.
